              <p>
                  Dwelling into forces, this unit will cover the basics of Newtonian physics and 
                  get you in the mindset of the ideas that energy in the universe is conserved and 
                  you can use this fact for forces as well as all of the force you exert on an object is 
                  never lost. You might have the force transferred into the pushing force felt by the object, and 
                  some will be lost to friction from the air and the surface. 
                  <br/><br/>
                  As an overview, you might be asked to know the four fundamental forces of nature and how they 
                  relate, most of these forces aren't brought up in this unit but are related to forces and so 
                  you might be required to know them by your instructor. <br/><br/>
                  These forces are (ranked by strongest to weakest):<br/>
                  1. Gravity<br/>
                  2. Weak Nuclear Force<br/>
                  3. Electromagnetic Force<br/>
                  4. Strong nuclear force<br/><br/>
                  For high school, only the gravitational and electromagnetic forces are brought up, and we will be 
                  talking about the graviational force in this unit and the electromagnetic force in a later unit. <br/><br/><br/>
                  Now, onto the main subject of this unit. Forces are described as strength or energy acting on an object 
                  or the object is exerting. The equation for force is F=ma, where force in newtons is a product of the 
                  mass of the object and the acceleration of the object. The units for force are always kilograms for the 
                  mass and m/s^2 for acceleration. If questions have different units for their information, remember to convert 
                  them to kilograms and m/s^2. For example, questions could tell you the mass of an object in grams, or give the 
                  acceleration in kilometers per hour, remember to convert these to their correct units.<br/><br/>
                  As an example type of question, you might be asked to figure out the force exerted on an object that 
                  has a mass of 100kg and is acceleration at 2m/s^2 (and with the assumption there are no other external forces 
                  such as friction). Through this, we know that the force exerting on this object will be transferred to it's motion, 
                  things cannot accelerate without an acting force. So using the formula we know that the amount of force acting on 
                  the object will be 200N. <br/><br/>
                  You will also be asked to find the acceleration of an object knowing its mass and force force acting on it, and 
                  the same for the mass of the object. <br/><br/><br/>
                  There are a couple of things to keep in mind about forces that your instructor might use as trick questions. <br/><br/>
                  1. On Earth, the force of gravity downward will always be acting, this force is based on the mass of the object, but the 
                  acceleration will always be -9.8m/s^2.<br/><br/>
                  2. If something is moving, that doesn't mean that there is a force acting on it. As long as the acceleration is 0m/s^2, there 
                  isn't a force acting  on it. So, if a car is moving at a constant velocity, then there isn't a force acting on it and the 
                  net force on the car is 0N. Forces are needed to get accelerate the object. Think of pushing on a block on a frictionless 
                  surface, as long as you are pushing on it, the block is accelerating, as soon as you let go, the block will 
                  skid at the constant velocity you let go with. The block won't start to accelerate and start skidding faster if there 
                  is no force on it. <br/><br/>
                  3. Forces are vectors and thereforce can be negative, the direction of the force matters when you have the find the 
                  net force. If you have 100N pushing the object forward and 50N pushing it back, then the net force will be the forces 
                  added up, but that doesn't mean you get the block moving with 150N acting on it. Instead, you have to define what's 
                  positive and negative, if the forward force is positive and the opposing force is negative, then the forces 
                  acting on the object are 100N and -50N. When adding up, we get that the net force on the object is 50N forward, this is to say 
                  that the behaviour of this block is identical to a block where it is being pushed 50N forward with no opposing forces. This 
                  is usually why gravity is set to be negative as for most problems it is the opposing force. But you can set the force to 
                  be whatever you want, you can make the force pushing an object backwards to be negative and the force pushing it forwards to be 
                  positive. <br/><br/>
                  4. Forces that act in one dimension won't oppose the other forces. Here is what I mean by that. Purely horizontal forces aren't affected 
                  by vertical forces. If you are pushing a block on a frictionless surface on the ground and you push the same block in freefall, the 
                  force to push it forward will be the same. Even though in one case you have the normal force and the force of gravity, acting on you, 
                  and in the other you just have the force of gravity. Because these forces were acting on you straight up and down, they don't 
                  affect the forces left and right. Now when working with forces acting on a diagonal, then you have to break it down 
                  into it's pure vertical and horizontal forces. <br/><br/>
                  5. Forces are equal and opposite, everything will exert a force back if you exert a force on it. As an example, 
                  If you push a block, the block is feeling the force you exerted on it, but you are also feeling the force as you struggle to push it, 
                  this makes sense internally, but might be different than our original intuition since the block doesn't push back at us, we're pushing it. 
                  In another case, if the moon and Earth have the same acting on them, why doesn't the Earth roatate around the moon. This is because 
                  if we go back to the equation for force, F=ma, we see that since the moon has a smaller mass, it's acceleration is larger and that's why it 
                  orbits us rather than vis versa. The Earth also rotates a little as well, but it's not as prominate as the moon. One more example, 
                  if you jump, you exerted a force on the Earth and the Earth accelerated a miniscule amount since it has such a large mass. But, the Earth exerted the 
                  same force on you and since you have a lower mass, you accelerate in the opposite direction, the action we call jumping.

              <p>
                  We'll briefly be going over gravity as it's just 1 equations and an explanation on how it works. <br/><br/>
                  So we all know that gravity is different for objects, the heavier something is, the more gravity it has. Everything 
                  has a force of gravity as long as it has mass. You exert a force of gravity on the Earth just like the Earth exerts a force 
                  on you, it's just that your force is less and doesn't move the Earth's mass as much as the Earth's mass moves you. 
                  <br/><br/><br/>
                  The equation for finding the force of gravity between two objects is:
              </p>
              <center><img src="images/36.png" class="img"></center>
              <p>
                  Some things to keep in mind, the radius is in meters and the mass is in kilograms, and radius is measured from the center of mass of each 
                  object, so radius between the Earth and a person standing on the ground would not be 0, but would be the radius of the Earth. 
                  Solving for this equation 
                  will get you the force of gravity between two objects, solving for it, you can find the acceleration of one of the masses 
                  since F=ma and you plug in the force of gravity and the mass of the object to see how much it accelerates. The reason 
                  why we say that the graviational field intensity of the Earth is -9.8m/s^2 is because every other mass on Earth by comparison 
                  is negligable and so it's roughly uniform between all masses. Yes there is a difference of how much an object accelerates depending on 
                  it's mass, but on Earth, the difference is so tiny that you would have to go to many decimal digits to find it. Ontop of this, 
                  if you try to find the acceleration of Earth when comparing to a human, you'll see that it will exist, but will be such a tiny amount since 
                  the Earth has such a large mass in comparison.

              <h1 id="Newtonian Forces">Newtonian Forces</h1>
              <p>
                  Newtonian forces are all about working with free body diagrams and F=ma. Before that, let's talk about Newton's three laws.
                  Most of these are self explanatory, but are still important in the world of proofs since even basic things need to be defined 
                  to allow for further additions in the theory of physics.<br/><br/>
                  I. An object will stay at rest, unless acted on by another external force. <br/>
                  What this is saying is that something not moving will not move unless something else acts on it. 
                  This can be in the form of a push, the object pushing off of a surface, or the force of gravity pulling it 
                  down on a ramp. <br/><br/>
                  II. The net force is the addition of all forces acting on an object.<br/>
                  This is the same thing I said before. If something has 10N pushing it forward, and 20N pushing it back, then the net force is 
                  the addition of these two, or 10 + -20 = -10N. So this is saying that this situation is the exact same as pushing the object 
                  with 10N backwards.<br/><br/>
                  III. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. <br/>
                  Again, this is the same thing I was originally saying. Pushing something down means that the surface is pushing up with the same force, 
                  if it wasn't then you would sink through it since F=ma (and thus acceleration has to be non-zero).
                  <br/><br/><br/>
                  There are a few types of force problems you will face. Some of the simplier ones just require you to find one variable in F=ma, 
                  this can be in the form of a block being pushed and given it's mass and acceleration and being asked to find the force. It can be in the 
                  form of having multiple forces acting on the block and you have to find the net force to get its, net force, mass, or acceleration. These questions 
                  are trivial and they're not worth getting too deep into. 
                  <br/><br/>
                  The second type of questions you might get are pulley questions. Having two blocks on either end of 
                  the pulley, given their masses and asked to find their acceleration. The trick to these ones is to find the force each block is experiencing individually (a = gravity), subtract 
                  each of their forces to get the net force and that is the direction the blocks will move. This basically means that the heavier one will pull the lighter one up and it will go down. 
                  To find the acceleration of these blocks, <b>if anything is every connected together, treat them as one object.</b> So when finding the acceleration after finding the net force, divide 
                  by the mass of both blocks, this always applies unless when talking about the force of tension which we'll get into. 
                  <br/><br/>
                  The third type of questions are similiar to the pulley ones, but instead you'll have a block resting on a surface connected to a pulley. This is virtually the same question and 
                  all of the previous rules apply, the only difference being that now the entire net force is through the hanging block and the block on the surface can be held due to firction. 
                  In terms of no friction on the surface, the same rules apply. If there is friction, then it will be represented by <b>mu</b>. 
                    Mu has no units, it's a coefficient and it helps us calculate the force of friction which <b>works against the force of the motion</b>. 
                    The way to calculate it is that the force of friction is mu * the normal force (-mg). 
              </p>
              <center><img src="images/37.png" class="img"></center>
              <p>
                  Finally, you'll get tension force problems where you just consider the block on it's own in a series of blocks. Remember how I said to treat 
                  blocks connected by a string as 1 object, with tension you consider them as individual blocks again and calculate the forces acting on them, 
                  usually meaning you find the tension on the string.

                <p>
                    Free body diagrams are not so much a type of question, but a tool you use to help calculate the forces acting on an object. This 
                    is helpful for finding net force, the force of tension, or figuring out what the problem is asking. Usually, if you don't have an idea 
                    of what to do, just throw a force diagram of the question and you'll likely figure it out or at least get some part marks.
