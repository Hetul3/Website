              <p>
                  The respiratory system has the major function of performing gas exchange so that 
                  your body can recieve the oxygen it needs and remove CO2 it doesn't. It also has the minor function 
                  of defending your body against microogranisms in the respiratory tract, producing sound, 
                  and assisting in the control of body fluid pH.<br/><br/>
                  The respiratory system is divided into two sections, the upper tract and lower tract.<br/><br/>
                  Upper Tract:<br/>
                  Nose/Nasal Cavity:<br/>

                   - Hairs filter dust and particles<br/>

                   - Tissues line the nasal cavity to moisten and warm the air<br/>

                   - Capillaries in the nose that when ruptured can cause nose bleed<br/>

                   - Preferred for inhalation<br/><br/>

                  Pharynx:<br/>

                   - Combines mouth and nose<br/>
                   - Splits into the trachea for air (Nasopharynx) and the esophagus (Oropharynx)<br/><br/>

                  Larynx:<br/>

                   - Voice box<br/>

                   - Epiglottis covers it<br/>

                   - Prevents food from liquids from entering into lungs<br/>

                   - Where the vocal cords are<br/><br/><br/>
                   Lower Tract:<br/>
                   Trachea:<br/>

                    - Long pipe that leads to the lungs<br/>

                    - Windpipe<br/>

                    - Cartilage covers the trachea<br/>

                   Bronchi:<br/>

                   - Divides trachea into two into each lung<br/><br/>

                   Bronchioles:<br/>

                   - Splits of bronchi that keeps splitting until it becomes ends where it contains alveoli<br/><br/>

                   Alveoli:<br/>

                    - There are 300 million alveoli<br/>

                    - The point of them is to increase surface area for gas exchange <br/>

                    - They are covered in capillaries that can allow for oxygen to transfer into the blood and CO2 from the lungs to go into the alveoli<br/>

                    - The air needs to be moist for the diffusion to occur<br/><br/>
                    Lungs:<br/>
                    - One of the largest organs of the body<br/>
                    - Has ribs to cover it and protect it, the ribs are connected by the intercostal muscles which expand and contract<br/>
                    - There is the diaphragm underneat which is basically pure muscle, 
                    it contracts and allows air to be drawn into the lungs, when 
                    relaxed it forces air out of the lungs<br/>
                    - The membrane that surronds the lungs is known as the pleural membrane
