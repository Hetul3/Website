              <h1 id="Speciation">Speciation</h1>
              <p>
                A species is a population that can produce with one another.
                <br/><br/>
                To be distinct, two species can't be able to breed with each other. New species when 
                an ancestor species diverges it's genetics to where it isn't able to breed with the 
                other species, or have their offspring survive to reproduce. 
                <br/><br/>
                The mechanisms preventing this falls under two main reasons. 
                Prezygotic isolation and postzygotic mortality.
                <br/><br/><br/><br/>
                Prezygotic Isolations: <br/><br/>
                1. Behavioural Isolation - If the mate isn't able to know the other's mating call. The mate 
                isn't able to recongize if the other wants to breed due to differences in mating calls and 
                patterns.
                <br/><br/>
                2. Temporal Isolation - Breeding times of the two organisms are different. Ex. one breeds in the 
                summer and other breeds in the winter. 
                <br/><br/>
                3. Mechanical Isolation - Reproductive organs don't match up. Due to differences in the sex organs, 
                the male isn't able to deliver the sperm to the egg. 
                <br/><br/>
                4. Gametic Isolation - The sperm isn't able to fertilize the egg. 
                <br/><br/>
                5. Ecological Isolation - The organisms occupy different regions. Ex. a species of squirrel occupies the 
                trees and the other occupies the ground. 
                <br/><br/><br/><br/>
                Postzygotic Mortality: <br/><br/>
                1. Zygotic Mortality - Ganetic differences between the two species results in an 
                underdevolped zygote that dies before birth or isn't able to develope further. 
                <br/><br/>
                2. Hybrid Inviability - The offspring dies before birth or cannot survive to maturity 
                and thus isn't able to reproduce it's genetic information.
                <br/><br/>
                3. Hybrid Infertility - The offspring born is healthy and is able to survive to maturity, 
                however the offspring is sterile.
                <br/><br/><br/><br/>
                There are two main types of speciations and how they occur. We first talked about the 
                mechanisms for speciation, now we'll talk about how this could happen. </p>
                <center><img src="images/2.png" class="img"></center>
                <br/>
                <p>
                Allopatric Speciation - The species are divided by a geographic barier and evolve to their 
                seperate habitats. This results genetic differences from the two groups who then evolve into 
                different species. Ex. The seperation of the island of Madagascar from the main African mainland 
                resulted in two different types of monkeys; the old world monkeys in Africa, and lemurs in 
                Madagascar. 
                <br/><br/>
                Sympatric Speciation - When chromosomes suddenly change because they reproduce with certain 
                individuals and not the whole group, even if they live nearby. Ex. the apple maggot would lay their 
                larvea in red apples, however a certain organisms laid their larvea in green apples, after some time, 
                the differences became great enough that they couldn't reproduce with each other. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Fossils:<br/>
                Simplier organisms are lower down in the layers of rock, while more complext organisms 
                are higher up. Providing evidence that organisms evolved to be more complex overtime. Ex. 
                Precambriam orgamisms were very simple, while those in the Mesozoic period are more complex.
                <br/><br/><br/>
                There are many different types of fossils as well.
                <br/><br/><br/>
                Body Fossils are divided into unaltered and altered remains. 
                <br/><br/>
                Altered Remains: 
                <br/>
                1. Encrustactian - Dissolved minerals in water that decompose the body.
                <br/><br/>
                2. Amber Entombment - Where the organism is trapped and perserved in amber. This can 
                contain some DNA and lots of detail, so Jurrasic Park was not far off. 
                <br/><br/>
                3. Refridgeration - Frozen preserves of the animal, it usually preserves cellular material and 
                is usually of recent large organisms, or bacteria in ice layers.
                <br/><br/><br/>
                Unaltered Remains:
                <br/>
                1. Permineralization - Where the pores of the organism are filled wuth dissolved minerals. 
                Results in no preservation of DNA, but the general shape of the organism is present.
                <br/><br/>
                2. Replacement - Acidic groundwater dissolves tissues, but contains great detail of the organism.
                <br/><br/>
                3. Recrystallization - Chemical reactions can change the chemical composition of the organism's 
                tissues. There is no preservation of DNA but has detail.
                <br/><br/>
                4. Carbonization - When pressure forces liquids and gases out of the organism, so the fossil is 
                very compact. Not very much detail.
                <br/><br/><br/>
                Trace Fossils are fossils a form of remain of the organism.
                <br/>
                1. Animal Tracks - Can help us determine their stride, speed, how they moved, if they moved in a 
                group, etc.
                <br/><br/>
                2. Gastroliths - Polished stones that helped herbivours digest and breakdown their foods. This 
                helps us know what their diet was like and how large the animal's stomach was. 
                <br/><br/>
                3. Coprolites - These are the extrements of the animal, they are their waste and they can tell us the 
                size of the animal, and their diet. 
                <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
                Comparative Anatomy:<br/>
                When there are similarities in certain features of different species. This also includes features 
                and structures that are of no use for the current the organim, ex. how humans still have a tailbone that 
                doesn't have a use for modern humans. 
                <br/><br/>
                1. Homologous Structures - When different species have similiar structures but have evolved for different uses. 
                This is also called divergent evolution. Ex. both humans and bats have the same general hand structure with the 
                same amount of fingers and segments, but they have evolved for different uses. A bat uses it's hand for flying, 
                and a human uses its hand for grabbing objects.
                <br/><br/>
                2. Analogous Structures - When different species have similiar looking features, but the structures are unrelated. 
                Hint of two different species that evolved similiarly due to to similiar environmental pressures. Also called 
                convergent evolution. Ex. both whales and dolphins are unrelated, however they evolved similiarly due to similiar 
                environmental pressures. Both animals have a blowhole, however the whale has two holes while dolphin has one, signs of 
                a different structure that became similiar. 
                <br/><br/>
                3. Vestigial Structures - Is a useless structure for the current organism, but was useful for their ancestors. Ex. 
                a whale has a hip bone that serves no purpose, but this structure was useful for it's ancestor who used to be terrestial. 
                <br/><br/><br/><br/>
                Comparative Embryology: <br/>
                During the embryotic stages of development, we see lots of similiar features for related animals. The longer two species look similiar 
                during the embryotic stages, the closer they are related. Ex. humans have gills in the first few stages, then lose them, showing that 
                they are distantly related to aquatic animals. </p>
                <center><img src="images/3.png" class="img"></center>
                <br/>
                <p>
                  Nucleic Acid Comparison: 
                  <br/>
                  Seeing the similiarities of DNA and RNA sequences in different species. Using this method, we can see that 
                  we're closer in relation to chimpanzees than gorillas, or that giant pandas are more related to the grizzly bear 
                  than red panda.
                  <br/><br/><br/><br/>
                  Amino Acid Comparison: <br/>
                  Checking the amino acide sequences that tell use the number of mutations between organism and hence how long 
                  they've been seperated.  
              </p>
              <h1 id="Mircoevolution">Microevolution and Patterns of Evolution</h1>
              <p>
                Microevolution: <br/>
                1. Mutations - They are the only way to add new genetic alleles and is how we can slowly vary from each other. 
                <br/><br/>
                2. Genetic Drift (Founder Effect) - When few individuals establish a new population. Because of there being few 
                individuals of a species, there is little genetic variation and thus the allele frequency will be different then 
                the original population. This usually happens by chance. Ex. if a population of humans all with blue eyes 
                establish a new population, then the repopulated population will have higher freqeuncy of blue eyes. 
                <br/><br/>
                3. Genetic Drift (Bottleneck) - An established population is reduced and the remaining who survived by change are able to 
                reproduce. 
                <br/><br/>
                4. Gene Flow - Immigration and emigration. Differen organisms with different alleles travel and intermingle with others 
                from different regions to introduce new alleles.
                <br/><br/>
                5. Natural Selection - In the small scale, not to the point of speciation.
                <br/><br/><br/><br/>
                Patterns of Evolution: <br/>
                1. Convergent Evolution - Analogous evolution. When non-related species become similiar due to similiar environmental pressures.
                </p>
                <center><img src="images/4.png" class="img"></center>
                <p>
                2. Divergent Evolution - Homologous evolution. When the smae or related species diverge and form different features depending on their 
                environmental pressures.
                </p>
                <center><img src="images/5.png" class="img"></center>
                <p>
                3. Adaptive Radiation - Filling an ecological niches that have not yet been exploited. Ex. the first land animal was filling 
                the ecological niche for land, as all other animals were in the ocean. Taking advantage of the resources present there. 
                <br/><br/>
                4. Co-evolution - As one species changes, anotehr dependant species changes along with it. Ex. the predator and prey relationship, 
                as the prey evolves to evade the predator, the predator evolves to better catch the prey.

              <p>
                Plato: <br/>
                Proposed the ideal form. Said that each object was an imperfect version of the perfect form. 
                The goal for each organism was to be as close to perfect and persue it.
                <br/><br/>
                Aristotle: <br/>
                Believed in a ladder of a scale of hierarcy, where your're stuck on your rung and can't move. Ex. a snail 
                would be like rung 3, while a tiger would be rung 5.
                <br/><br/>
                George Louis de Buffon: <br/>
                Species originated in more than one place and have the possibility of being modified over time. 
                <br/><br/>
                William Smith: <br/>
                Different types of organisms lived in dfferent time periods. His evidence was that similiar fossils were found 
                in the same layer of rock. 
                <br/><br/>
                George Cuvier: <br/>
                Believed in an original creation of all species at the same time. All species were created at the same time, but 
                a diaster wiped all of them out and a new batch were created. His evidence was that the layers of fossils were 
                bunched similiarily by time. Ex. a layer of dinosuars, then it all of the sudden changed to a layer of mammals.
                <br/><br/>
                Louis Agassiz: <br/>
                He doubled down on Cuvier's theory and proposed that there were at least 50 catastrophes that wiped out and created 
                new ones. 
                <br/><br/>
                Jean Baptiste Lamarck: <br/>
                If a creature had drive to adapt, it would due to the "fluida" within the organism. The trait inherited would be passed 
                down to the next generation. Ex. Giraffes got their long necks because an individual wanted to reach the leaves on the 
                top of trees, and so through determination it was able to stretch it's neck and pass down it's trait.
                <br/><br/>
                Charles Lyll: <br/>
                Earth was more than 6000 years old (was the dominant theory at the time). His evidence was of the fossil layers and 
                was able to measure the time between each layer. Also proposed Earth sculpting, where the Earth's crust changes overtime.
                <br/><br/>
                Thomas Malthus: <br/>
                Correlated that overpopulation lead to famine, war, and disease which would decrease the population size, with only 
                the strongest surviving and reproducing.
                <br/><br/>
                Charles Darwin: <br/>
                Proposed the theory of natural selection, where traits are selected for due to their advantage and the traits are passed down.
                <br/><br/>
                Alfred Wallace: <br/>
                Independantly derived the theory of natural selection a little bit after Darwin, both were good friends.

                Darwin's Observations: <br/>
                 - Offsprings of a population outnumber parents<br/>
                 - Steady state stability of populations, populations did not grow in size<br/>
                 - Food and resources are limited<br/>
                 - Individuals within a population vary with traits<br/>
                 - Traits are passed down from parent to offspring, generation to generation<br/><br/>
                 Darwin's Infrences:<br/>
                 - Individuals within a population must compete for resources<br/>
                 - Advantageous traits are passed down as the inidividual is more likely to survive<br/><br/>
                 Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection:<br/>
                 As time goes on, advantagous traits become more common within the population, generation to generation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
                 Types of Selection:<br/>
                1. Stabilizing selection:
                <br/>The medium trait within an organism is favoured, the two extremes pose a disadvantage and it is the middle trait 
                that will pose the greatest andvantage. Ex. human baby size, babies born too small will not have enough nutrients to survive 
                and will likely not reach maturity. Babies to large won't be able to be born due to their large size, likely killing both 
                the baby and the mother. The medium size is most favoured for survival. <br/><br/>
                2. Directional selection:<br/>
                One extreme of a trait is favoured over all else. Ex. for certain lizards, a longer tail is more favoured since it 
                better resembles that of a snake, scaring away potiential predators. A short tail does not have this advantage and 
                a medium sized tail doesn't give as large of an advantage. <br/><br/>
                3. Disruptivel selection:<br/>
                Both extremes of a trait is favoured, and the middle trait poses the most disadvantages. Ex. brown and white coloured 
                hares are able to better blend in dirt and snowy environments respectively. However the middle trait of a grey hare 
                will get spotted in both environments. <br/><br/>
                4. Sexual Selection: <br/>
                Traits that attract the most mates are favoured. The more mates that are attracted, the more offsprings the individual 
                will have and the allele will become more common in the species. Ex. the birds of paradise use many ways to attract a mate 
                whether that be through their show of strength, attrativeness, dances, etc.
