              <p>
                A short review of mitosis as nothing new is covered in the grade 11 material. <br/><br/>
                Mitosis is the process of which cells copy their DNA and divide, splitting into 
                two cells. The main steps of mitosis are broken down into interphase, prophase, 
                metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis. <br/><br/>
                </p>
                <center><img src="images/8.png" class="img"></center>
                <p>
                Interphase: <br/>
                Interphase takes up the majority of the cell's life, it's further divided up into 
                G1, synthesis, and G2. G1 is where the cells grows in size and performs it's natural 
                functions. Synthesis is where the DNA is packaged into chromosomes and copied as it 
                gets ready for mitosis. G2 is when the cell grows some more and starts replicating 
                its organelles as it prepares for mitosis. <br/><br/>
                Prophase:<br/>
                The nuclear envelope dissolves, allowing for the chromosomes to move freely. The centromeres migrate 
                to opposite sides of the cell and the centrioles release their spindle fibres. <br/><br/>
                Metaphase: <br/>
                The spindle fibres line up the chromosomes in the middle of the cell on what's called the 
                metaphase plate. <br/><br/>
                Anaphase: <br/>
                The fibres pull their respective copy of the chromosomes to their sides.<br/><br/>
                Telophase and Cytokinesis: <br/>
                The nuclear envelope on each side reforms, the physical seperation of the cell happens 
                as new membrane is being formed for the two cells. <br/><br/><br/>

                So that was a quick review of mitosis, now we'll be moving onto meiosis. <br/><br/>
                Meiosis is the process of creating the gametes of each sex, eggs for females, and sperm for males. 
                Females are actually born with all the eggs they will ever have for their lifetimes, and males 
                produce about 1 billion sperm cells everyday for their whole lives. <br/><br/>
                For both sexes, a gametes cell contains 46 chromosomes, which them splits into two haploid cells 
                with 23 chromosomes each. This splits again into 4 haploid cells who also have 23 chromosomes. 
                The first division is called meiosis 1, the second division is called meiosis 2.<br/><br/><br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                Meiosis 1:<br/>
                <center><img src="images/9.png" class="img"></center>
                </p>
                <p>
                During meiosis 1, we have 46 chromosomes, with 23 of them being in pairs. The cell goes under 
                prophase 1, where the twin chromosomes cross over their genetic material, the crossing over allows 
                them to exchange genetic information and is how we end up with variation in our offsprings, or else 
                they would be identical to their parents. This is one of two ways that that we get genetic variation.
                <br/>
                </p>
                <center><img src="images/10.png" class="img"></center>
                <p>
                The cell then goes under metaphse 1, all the way to telophase 1. During this division, most things go 
                on as normal like in normal cell division. This is also where we can get our second way of getting genetic variation.
                 Depending on the order at which the chromosomes are aligned, some chromosomes will get pulled to one haploid and another will get 
                pulled to another, since only one gamete will get to fertilize, it's important what order the chromosomes 
                are aligned. <br/><br/>
                </p>
                <center><img src="images/11.png" class="img"></center>
                <p>
                Meiosis 2: <br/>
                <center><img src="images/12.png" class="img"></center>
                </p>
                <p>
                For meiosis 2, there is no interphase 2, the cells don't replicat their chromosomes, instead each 
                cell when they divide will get a chromatid. At the end of telophase 2, you'll end up with 4 unique 
                gametes with unique genetic information. <br/><br/><br/>
                Gametogenesis:<br/>
                Gametogenesis is the difference between the gametes of the two sexes. For males, you end up with 
                4 unique sperm cells with unique genetic material, all of the cells are viable for fertilizing the 
                egg. This is also called spermatogenesis.<br/><br/>
                For females, during the first division, one haploid will be healthy and the other will not be in 
                consideration for being an egg, the unhealthy haploid is called the first polar body. During the second 
                division, one haploid will be healthy and chosen to be the egg while the other will become a polar body, 
                so in the end, you'll end up with 1 ovum (surviving egg) and 3 polar bodies. The difference between the 
                polar bodies and the ovum, is that the ovum is the only one that has cell organelles, as it's the mother 
                who will supply the organelles.
              </p>
              <h1 id="DNA">DNA</h1>
              <p>
                  Here, we'll be covering the DNA structure and how DNA replicates.<br/><br/><br/>
                  DNA is made up of nucleotides, these nucleotides act as a template for which 
                  helps produce specific proteins of the cell. The protein and the amount of protein 
                  a cell produces essintially describes its function. <br/><br/>
                  These bases are Thymine(T), Adenine(A), Cytosine(C), and Gaunine(G). The sequence of 
                  which these bases are arranged helps build the proteins. 
              </p>
              <center><img src="images/13.png" class="img"></center>
              <p>
                  Base A is always connected to T with two hydrogen bonds. C is always connected to 
                  G with three hydrogen bonds. G and A are distinguishable through their make-up being 
                  2 bonded rings, while T and C are 1 bonded ring. So, if you have a RNA strand (one half of the DNA), 
                  you can tell what the other end would be if it was DNA. We'll soon see how this fact is used 
                  by enzymes to duplicate DNA. <br/><br/>
                  The side when referring to the DNA backbone is either 3' or 5'. Depending on which way your looking at 
                  it, if the phospate group is above the respective sugar molecule, then going up is the 5' side, and going 
                  down would be the 3' side. The sides are reversed for the other side. <br/><br/><br/>
                  DNA undergoes replication during the synthesis phase of the cell cycle. This is in preperation for 
                  when the cell divides so that each cell has a full copy of DNA. 
              </p>
              <center><img src="images/14.png" class="img"></center>
              <p>
                  1. The enzyme Helicase unzips the DNA like unzipping a zipper. This allows for each 
                  half to be replicated. Since knowing the bases of one end of the DNA allows you to determine 
                  the bases of the other end. This means that you each strand can be replicated independently. 
                  <br/><br/>
                  2. The enzyme Primase will add a short sequence of RNA and that marks the starting line to 
                  where the rest of the DNA can be replicated. <br/><br/>
                  3. Next, DNA Polymerase is the main enzyme that starts to generate the other end of the DNA. It 
                  will bind to the primer and begin to replicate the side of the DNA. 
                  It is able to add bases and will follow the Helicase while replicating as it goes along. However, 
                  the enzyme can add bases from the 5' to 3' end. This means that for one strand (leading strand), only one DNA Polymerase 
                  is needed to replicate the whole side. But for the other strand (lagging strand), you need to constantly add new DNA 
                  Polymerases as more DNA is unzipped. <br/><br/>
                  4. For the lagging strand, the DNA has to be replicated in fragments. Fragments are started through 
                  a new Primer. A new DNA Polymerase will being the sequence until it hits a end of another fragment created. 
                  These fragments are called Okazaki fragments, named after the person who discovered them. This process is repeated 
                  until the whole strand is compeletely replicated. <br/><br/>
                  5. Once the everything has been replicated, DNA Ligase goes through to connect the different fragments to 
                  make a continous backbone strand. Once everything is completed, you end up with two copies of DNA.
              </p>

              <h1 id="Mutations">Mutations</h1>
              <p>
                  Mutations is the primary method from which new genetic variation is introduced. We'll specifically 
                  be talking about the different types of mutations, those that effect each nucleotide, and those 
                  that effect large geneome sequences. These mutations can occur in somatic cells which aren't passed down 
                  or in gametes which can be passed on. <br/><br/>
                  Most mutations are neutral in their effect, however some can be deadly.<br/><br/>
                  Chromosome Mutations:<br/>
                   - Deletion - A piece of chromosome is lost<br/>
                   - Inversion - A fragment of the chromosome breaks off and reattaches inverted.<br/>
                   - Duplication - A sequence is repeated<br/>
                   - Translocation - When two non-homologous chromosomes exchange a fragment <br/>
                   - Nondisjunction - Failure of a chromosome to seperate properly during meiosis <br/>
                   <center><img src="images/16.png" class="img"></center>
              </p>
              <p>
                  Gene Mutations:<br/>
                   - Point Mutations - A change to a single nucleotide. This includes deletion, insertions, or subsitution<br/>
                   - Frameshift Mutations - When one or more nucleotides are changed. Includes inserting and deleting<br/>

              <h1 id="Genetic Technologies">Genetic Technologies</h1>
              <p>
                  There are three main genetic technologies taught in the cirriculum. <br/><br/>
                  DNA Fingerprinting:<br/>
                  DNA fingerprinting produces a pattern of bands on a gel that is characteristic of each 
                  individual but highly variable from person to person. For the way that it works, it 
                  uses the fact that DNA is negatively charged and therefore will attract to a positively 
                  charged plate. In a machine called the "electrophoresis", two plates, a negatively and positively 
                  charged one are placed on either side. DNA samples go in the machine and when turned on, the small 
                  stretches of DNA is able to quickly migrate to the positive end, while the larger fragments take time. 
                  This allows us to have a unique DNA fingerprint for each person depending on their DNA structure and sequence.
              </p>
              <center><img src="images/18.png" class="img"></center>
              <p>
                  Genetic Engineering:<br/>
                  Genetic engineering is a technique with which we can alter genetic information in 
                  organisms. Bacteria have small circular pieces of DNA called plasmids. Restriction 
                  enzymes are able to cut out specific sequences of DNA. Restriction enzymes cut out 
                  parts of DNA from an organism with desired traits. We can then cut out a section of 
                  the plasmid from the bacteria, making sure that the ends have complementary DNA sequences 
                  as the ends of the cut DNA from the organism. These ends are called "sticky ends", they allow 
                  for the seemless transition from the desired trait to the bacteria's DNA so that nothing unexpected 
                  happens. After combining the plasmid with the desired DNA, we put the plasmid back into the bacteria. 
                  We put these new bacterias in the same environment as another organism we wish to pass the desired trait 
                  down to, the bacteria will enter the organism and incorporate the new gene to the genome of the organims. 
                  When the new organism grows, it will have the desired gene in it's genome and have the desired trait. 
              </p>
              <center><img src="images/19.png" class="img"></center>
              <p>
                  Gene Therapy:<br/>
                  Gene therapy is simple to implement, however it's unpredictable and can result in error. Viruses inject 
                  viral DNA into cells in order to change the genome of the cell to start making more viruses. What gene 
                  therapy has done is that this viral DNA is removed and in place is a desired gene. The viruses goes into 
                  the body and spread this gene by incorporating it into each cell, and thus altering the DNA sequence to something 
                  more desirable. However, the method can be unpredictable as the virus can regain their viral DNA along with 
                  a mutation. You also need a large number of viruses to have an affect since the viral code that replicated the 
                  virus is removed.
              </p>

              <h1 id="Cloning">Cloning</h1>
              <p>
                  Cloning is the process by which we are able to make an identical genetic copy of an organism. 
                  Technically, asexual reproduction already does this since there are no variations of offsprings, 
                  while sexual reproduction results in offsprings. This property of no just replicating can also be 
                  extended by organisms that undergo asexual reproduction. Carrots as an example are able to grow 
                  into entirely new organisms through just a sample of their DNA being able to grow. 
              </p>
              <center><img src="images/21.png" class="img"></center>
              <p>
                  However, the persuit of cloning is on organisms that reproduce sexually. Being able to create a 
                  genetic copy of yourself brings up a lot of ethical controversies, however we'll just be talking about 
                  how it's done. <br/><br/>
                  The current method of cloning was also used to clone Dolly the sheep in 1996. First, you extract an 
                  egg cell from another individual or from the same individual. You manually remove the nuclues of the 
                  egg and hence the DNA of it, this produces a enucleated egg cell. You take any somatic cell from the 
                  individual you want to copy and use electric pulses to fuse the somatic cell and the egg cell. This 
                  results in the egg cell having the full 46 chromosomes needed to start fertilization. That egg cell will 
                  be implanted in a surrogate mother who will have to take care of the embryo. When the fetus is born, you'll 
                  have an identical copy.
              </p>

              <h1 id="Karyotyping and Sex Chromosomes">Karyotyping and Sex Chromosomes</h1>
              <p>
                  Karyotyping is mapping out the chromosomes. Karyotyping can help us find how many of 
                  each chromosomes are there. Helping us find non-disjunction disorders which occur due 
                  to an error in meiosis that results in more or less chromosomes in a group. 
              </p>
              <center><img src="images/23.png" class="img"></center>
              <p>
                  The sex chromosomes appear in chromosome 23, they are the chromosomes that determine the sex 
                  of the offspring. An XX means that the offspring is female, while an XY means the offspring 
                  is male. Females will always supply an X chromosome and males have a 50/50 chance of supplying 
                  an X or a Y chromosome. In the picture above, the karyoptype shows the individual to be a female 
                  due to the two Xs.<br/><br/><br/>
                  Due to errors in meiosis, through the chromosomes being more "sticky" individuals can have more or less 
                  than two of each chromosome, this is referred to as non-disjunction syndromes. The most common ones are 
                  trisomy and monosomy. Trisomy means that there are three chromsomes in group, and monosomy means that there 
                  is only one chromosome in a group. For a lot of these cases, the fetus won't be able to develop properly 
                  and die prematurely, some non-disjunction individuals can survive, but the individual will have complications.

                  Some of the most common syndromes:<br/><br/><br/>
                  Turner Syndrome - Due to only 1 X chromsome. Females in appearance but do not mature secually and 
                  are sterile.<br/><br/>
                  Klinefelter Syndrome - 2 Xs and 1 Y. Males are sterile and exhbit female body characteristics.<br/><br/>
                  Patau Syndrome - Trisomy of chromosome 13. Many have severe developmental problems.<br/><br/>
                  Edwards Syndrome - Trisomy of chromosome 18. Many organ system defects.
