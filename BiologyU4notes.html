              <h1 id="Circulatory System">Circulatory System</h1>
              <p>
            Major Functions<br/>
             - Moving nutrients from intestine to all body cells<br/>
             - Blood flowing through the lungs picks up oxygen which is transported to the cells<br/>
             - Carriers wastes from body tissues for disposal<br/><br/><br/>
                
             Minor Functions<br/>
             - Regulate body temperature<br/>
             - Transport WBC to areas of the body where there are viruses or bacteria<br/>
             - Transport hormones<br/><br/><br/>
                
            There are three major parts of the circulatory system, the blood, heart, and vessels.          
            </p>
            <h1 id="Types of Circulatory Systems">Types of Circulatory Systems</h1>
            <p>
            There are two types of circulatory systems, open and closed circulatory systems. <br/><br/>

            Closed Circulatory System:<br/>

            This is what we’re used to, it is us, mammals, earthworms, fish, etc. Here, the blood is contained in vessels and almost always stay in these vessels as they travel throughout the body. Usually this means that the vessels are closed and travel out to tissues, then come back to replenish their nutrients. <br/><br/>

            Open Circulatory System:<br/>

            This time, the circulatory system is open and can go directly to the tissues that need it and bathe in it. This is unlike the closed circulatory system where the blood is always in the vessels and never leaves it. Lobsters and most other invertebrates have this system. <br/><br/><br/>

            In closed circulatory systems, the most common one we are used to is the two circuit system. This is where the blood will go to the heart to be sent to the tissues, then go back to the heart to be sent to the lungs to replenish their nutrients. So, if the organism has lungs, then it has a two circuit system. These systems are the pulmonary circuit (going to and back from the lungs), and systemic circuit (going to and back from the tissues).<br/>

            <h1 id="Types of Blood Cells">Types of Blood Cells</h1>
            <p>
                Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes):<br/>

                 - Most abundant<br/>

                 - Vitamin B12 is needed to produce red blood cells<br/>

                 - The red blood cells can be different blood types due to their flags, we went through this in depth in the <a>Mendelian Genetics Unit</a>.<br/>

                 - Carry oxygen for the tissues to use to make ATP, they carry this through hemoglobin<br/>

                 - They carry out waste CO2<br/><br/><br/>

                White Blood Cells (leukocytes):<br/>

                 - Fight infections<br/>

                 - They make up less than 1% of the blood<br/>

                 - The only blood cells with a nucleus<br/><br/><br/>

                Platelets:<br/>

                 - Help with blood clotting<br/>

                 - Make up less than 1% of blood<br/>

                 - Hemophilia is when blood cannot clot and a person continues to bleed<br/><br/><br/>

                Plasma:<br/>

                 - The protein rich liquid that carries all of the blood cells<br/>

                 - 90% of plasma is water<br/>

            <h1 id="Blood Vessels">Blood Vessels</h1>
            <p>
              Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart and toward the body tissues. The large artery that leaves the heart is called the aorta, and it branches into the major arteries that carry the blood. <br/><br/>
Arteries have 3 layers, the innermost layer is the endothelium, then there is a layer of smooth muscle, and all of this is connected by the connective tissue. When the artery splits, it’s called the arteriole. <br/><br/>
The way that the blood flow is controlled is through the use of nerves that relax or contract the muscle tissue layer. When relaxed, there is increased blood flow, and when contracted there is less blood flow. This is how and why your hands get cold first because they’re not vital organs in the cold, so the brain contracts the arteries to reduce blood flow. When the diameter is increased or muscle is relaxed, it’s called <b>vasodilation</b>, and when it contracts, it’s called <b>vasoconstriction</b>. <br/><br/>
In contrast with arteries, veins have the complete opposite direction of flow. Both veins and arteries combine in small capillary networks. The capillary networks are really small, but really long. The point of them is to increase surface area in the tissue so that every cell in the tissue gets the nutrients they need from the red blood cells. You can imagine this like the tissues being towns, veins and arteries being highways, and the capillaries being the streets in the town. Splits in veins are called venule.<br/><br/>
Fluid exchange occurs in capillaries, due to difference in pressure and water concentration, water diffuses from the blood to the tissues. This decreases the concentration of water in the blood, but increases the concentration of dissolved substances and protein. This is done on the arterial side of the capillaries. On the venous side, water diffuses from the tissue to the blood and the dissolved substances move from the blood to the tissues. <br/><br/>
Capillaries have no muscle layer and can’t be controlled through the nervous system. Instead, there are sphincter muscles where the arteriole branches. These sphincter muscles serve the same function as the dilation and constriction of arterioles.<br/><br/>
Blood Pressure:<br/>
A pulse is evidence that the arteries are swelling due to the heart’s contractions, putting the blood under pressure. Blood pressure is measured with a sphygmomanometer. The first reading the instrument gives off is the systolic pressure, which is the pressure in the artery when the heart contracts. The second reading is the diastolic pressure, and is when the heart is relaxed and blood is flowing through the artery. 
<br/><br/>
Other information:<br/>
 - Bruising is just internal bleeding<br/>
 - Cardiovascular problems (mainly related to blood pressure) is the most likely cause of death<br/>
 - The brain will try to correct changes in blood pressure, but will see high blood pressure as the new normal if it’s a gradual change<br/>
 - Artery has the thickest walls, veins have smaller walls (due to not having a lot of tunica media since they rely on their valves), and the capillaries have the smallest walls<br/>
 - Arteries are somewhat circular, veins are distorted, and capillaries are circular in shape<br/>
 - The pressure of blood decreases going from arteries, to capillaries, to venules, to veins, with the veins having the lowest pressure<br/>
 - Even though veins have the lowest blood pressure, they have more blood velocity than capillaries but less than arteries because they have less cross sectional area than capillaries<br/>

            <h1 id="Lymphatic System">Lymphatic System</h1>
            <center><img src="images/42.png" class="img"></center>
            <p>
              The lymphatic system has two major roles:<br/>

               - Immune system<br/>

               - Circulatory system<br/><br/>
               As part of the circulatory system, the lymphatic system helps ensure that the blood volume is maintained, as part of the immune system, the lymphatic system filters bacteria and other components of the blood. <br/><br/>
As blood circulates through the capillaries, some proteins leak from the blood into the tissue fluid. The excess tissue fluid is collected in lymph vessels and returned to the blood in the veins. When the fluid is in the lymph system, it is known as lymph. They are important because without them, the body’s tissues would inflate and swell. <br/><br/>
For the immune system, the lymphatic system has lymph nodes where leukocytes gather and destroy viruses and bacteria. Swollen nodes means the body is fighting a serious infection. The spleen acts as a filtering station for the system, with the tonsils serving a similar function. The thymus is a critical organ of the immune system, and it secretes hormones that help lymphocytes recognize and attack specific foreign invaders.

            <h1 id="The Heart">The Heart</h1>
            <p>
              The main function of the heart is to maintain pressure to keep the blood flowing through the circulatory system so that the muscles and organs get the nutrients they need<br/><br/>
The main things of the heart you need to know are the different parts of the heart:<br/>
 - You’ll need to know the different chambers and their functions.<br/>
 - The valves that let blood flow through but not back in. <br/>
 - The main veins and arteries that are connected to the heart.<br/><br/>
For the most part, this is the main thing you need to know about the heart, so try to memorize the diagrams below for the test. <br/><br/>
Most of you might’ve learned the function of the different chambers, for those who didn’t, it’s pretty simple. There are only 4 chambers, split up into ventricles and atriums, and split up into the left and right sections. So you get these different chambers and their functions:<br/>
 - Left atria receives blood full of oxygen and empties it to the left ventricle <br/>
 - Left ventricle pumps the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body through the aorta<br/>
 - Right atria receives deoxygenated blood and empties it to the right ventricle<br/>
 - Right ventricle pumps the deoxygenated blood to the lungs to get oxygen<br/><br/>

<p>
The coronary arteries and coronary veins are blood vessels that supply the heart with oxygen to keep working. Even though the heart pumps blood, it doesn’t extract any oxygen, so the coronary blood vessels supply these nutrients.<br/><br/><br/>

Another important thing to keep in mind are the pacemakers of the heart. The heart keeps rythemic beats through the help of the SA node. The 
SA node is the pacemaker of the heart and keeps track of the time between beats. This rythem is passed to the AV node which delays the signals a bit 
before signalling them off to the Parkinje fibres. These go throughout the heart and is what tells the septum (muscles of the heart) to contract and relax. <br/><br/>
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to measure the heartbeat of a person. You've probably seen the different beats and waves in movies or 
in the hospital. Each wave represents a different action of the heart. <br/><br/>
</p>
<center><img src="images/39.png" class="img"></center>
<p>


The P wave represents the atrium contracting and sending blood to the ventricles, the QRS waves represent the ventricles beating and pumping 
the blood out of the heart, and the T wave represents the relaxation of the ventricles after the beat. This is repeated for whenever the heart beats.
