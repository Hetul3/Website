                  Physics is all about practice. Practicing equations until you become comfortable, 
                  practicing concepts until you're familiar, and practicing with problems.<br/><br/>
                  This is why what I can help you with is giving you notes, specific details you might 
                  be tested on, the basic concept, and some tips and tricks that teachers put on the test. <br/><br/>
                  If you would like practice and <a href="" class = "text" target="_blank">1:1 tutoring</a>, you can do that.
                  <br/><br/><br/>
                  In kinematics, there are only a few terms you must know.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Velocity:<br/>
                  The change of position over time, velocity is basically how fast you are 
                  changin poisition. Velocity is a vector, this means that it's important if velocity 
                  is positive or negative. Basically, the direction of the object's velocity matters, 
                  if velocity is positive, then the object is moving forward, negative it's moving backwards.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Speed:<br/>
                  Similiar to velocity in that it measure's the rate of change of position. However, 
                  speed is a scaler quantity, meaning that it can only be positive. The speed of an object 
                  does not reflect the direction it's moving.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Accelerations: <br/>
                  The rate of change of velocity, just like how velocity is the rate of change of 
                  position. Acceleration is also a vector like velocity and if acceleration is greater than 0, then 
                  the object's velocity is increasing. 
                  <br/><br/><br/>
                  The definition of these three terms is used to help solve distance-time, velocity-time, and acceleration-time 
                  graphs. Going from distance to velocity, you take the tangent line at key points to guide the velocity graph, 
                  the slope of the tangent is the velocity value at that time. The same thing is true when moving from 
                  velocity to acceleration graphs.<br/><br/>
                  When moving the other way around, you need to calculate the area under the curve, find the sum from t = 0, to 
                  the point you are calculating, that will represent the point.

            <p>
              There are five main equations of kinematics, each of them help solve for one of these variables.
              <br><br>
               - Acceleration (a)<br>
               - Velocity final (v<sub>f</sub>)<br>
               - Velocity initial (v<sub>i</sub>)<br>
               - Distance (d<sub>1</sub> for first distance value, d<sub>2</sub> for final distance value, and delta d for the difference of each)<br>
               - Time (t)<br><br>
               Each equation excludes the need of one of these variables. You can solve for any variable in each equation as 
               long as you have all the other variables by solving for the desired varibale.

              Usually, the graphs are pretty straight forward in what you're supposed to do, doing practice problems on 
              them and finding any weird cases can make sure you are prepared for those types of questions. 
              <br/><br/>
              There are a few things to keep in mind for the equations of kinematics problems.<br/><br/>
              1. You can solve for a variable by rewriting one of the equations to solve for that variable. 
              You can make sure of this by writing down all you given variables and their values, what you are 
              trying to find, and maybe what variable you are missing. This will allow you to pick the correct equation 
              and fill in all your givens to find an unfilled variable you are trying to find. <br/><br/>
              2. Most likely you will not be required to memorize these equations, they are trying to test you on 
              your problem solving rather than purely the fact that you are able to memorize the equations. If you are 
              however required to memorize the equations, there are two things that can help. First, most of the equations 
              are rewritten versions of other equations, knowing one of them will help you derive the other if you know 
              how each term relates to each other term. Second, you can force yourself to memorize the equations you don't know 
              for 1-2 minutes before you're handed the test and write them down on top as the first thing you do so you don't have 
              to memorize it for the whole test, it's just there.<br/><br/>
              3. Sometimes teachers will present a difficult question where there are multiple variables that are not given 
              and no one equation helps you find the unknown. For this, find the equation that solves for the unknown you want to 
              solve for, and it contains the most amount of the variables you are given. Find and solve for the equation with the 
              missing variable you do not have and plug that into the first equation to solve for the unknown. Instead of using one 
              equation, you have to solve with two equations. <br/><br/>
              4. You might not be blatently given a variable in the question, but will be required to know what the value is. For example, 
              when dealing with vertical motion, you won't be given acceleration but you have to know that the acceleration will be -9.8m/s^2 for gravity. 
              Similiarly, if an apple drops from a tree and hits the ground, the initial velocity will be 0m/s and the final distance will 
              be 0m.
