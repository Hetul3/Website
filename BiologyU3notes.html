                  There generally isn't much information in this unit. The main focus is that you 
                  are able to do problems that involve punnett squares, pedigrees, and dihybrids. I'll 
                  be teaching the basics of how to solve these problems and their different variations. 
                  At the end I'll include some practice problems that you should practice for the unit test.
                  <br/><br/>
                  The main ideas of this unit is to find the genotypes and phenotypes of offsprings or parents 
                  given the information. Using the genetics to find the probability. This is important because 
                  it teaches you how traits are passed down.<br/><br/>
                  Here are some general terms that are important<br/><br/><br/>
                  Genotype:<br/>
                  The genetic information carried. The genotype of an organism is its complete set of 
                  genetic material. Genotype can also be used to refer to the alleles or variants an 
                  individual carries in a particular gene or genetic location. 
                  <br/><br/>
                  Phenotype:<br/>
                  The outward expression of a gene. An individual could have the genotype containing a trait, but 
                  the trait might not be expressed due to another dominant trait. Phenotype is the outward appearence, 
                  or the gene that is expressed.<br/><br/>
                  Dominant:<br/>
                  The dominant gene. Between two genes the individual has, the dominant gene is the one that is expressed over 
                  the other. Only 1 dominant gene is needed for that gene to be expressed and determine the phenotype of the 
                  individual<br/><br/>
                  Ressesive:<br/>
                  The ressesive gene. Out of two genes, the ressesive will not be expressed if a dominant gene is present. 
                  For the ressisive gene to be expressed, both genes need to be ressesive.<br/><br/>
                  Homozygous:<br/>
                  Both genes are the same. If both genes are dominant, then they are referred as homozygous dominant. 
                  If both genes are ressesive, then their homozygous ressesive.<br/><br/>
                  Hetrozygous:<br/>
                  There are two different genes present. A hetrozygous would have a dominant and a ressesive gene present. <br/><br/>
              </p>

                <h1 id="Punnett Squares">Monohybrids</h1>
                <p>
                    Punnett squares is a simple way to predict the traits of the offspring of two parents. 
                    Generally only 1 or a few traits are considered in punnett squares and they act as 
                    a way to calculate the probability of the trait of the offspring. <br/><br/>
                    In punnett square problems, you'll be asked to find the probability of the genotype and 
                    phenotype of the offspring given the parents' genotype. Asked to find the genotype of the parents, 
                    given the probability chance of their offsprings. And be asked to calculate this for multiple 
                    generations.<br/><br/>
                    An important note is that for proper notation, the dominant gene is represented by a capital, and 
                    the ressesive gene is represented as a lowercase. Always have a let statement representing each 
                    gene unless given. For now we'll be looking at a monohybrid cross which considers 
                    only 1 gene, we'll later do a dihybrid cross.<br/><br/><br/>

                    Step 1: Set up the punnett square<br/><br/>
                    Step 2: Put the parents genotypes on each axis <br/><br/>
                    Step 3: Cross the genes on each square<br/><br/>
                    Step 4: Extract the probability of the genotype and phenotype of the offspring

                    <br/><br/>
                The general idea for the punnett square carries over to other types, however the method that 
                we've been doing has been dominant and ressesive genes. This means that only one or the other is 
                expressed. But there are other ways that genes can be expressed.<br/><br/><br/>
                Incomplete Dominance:<br/>
                Incomplete dominance is where both genes can be expressed in a mix. For example, the snapdragon flowers 
                express their flower petal colors in this sort of order. A red snapdragon mated with a white snapdragon 
                will produce a pink snapdragon. <br/><br/>
                Notation for this is to have have the captial superscript of each trait and have the base be a general symbol for 
                the traits. When mixing doin punnet crosses, if you have homozygous alleles, then that trait will be expressed, 
                hetrozygous of the traits will produce a mix of both. 
                </p>
                <center><img src="images/27.png" class="img"></center>
                <p>
                    Codominance: <br/>
                    Codimance is similiar to incomplete dominance, however both genes are expressed fully, not a mix 
                    of both. <br/><br/>
                    Notation for this is also similiar to incomplete dominance, the only difference is that the superscripts 
                    are lowercase.
                </p>
                <center><img src="images/28.png" class="img"></center>
                <h1 id="Dihybrids">Dihybrids</h1>
                <p>
                    Dihybrids are just double to that of monohybrids that we've been doing. They not feature 
                    two alleles and the result will have the description of the two alleles. Everything else is 
                    the exact same as monohybrids except dihybrids are larger.<br/><br/>
                    There are two ways to do dihybrids. You could make a 4x4 grid, or do each associated allele 
                    punnett squares seperately and multiply the results. 
                </p>

            <h1 id="Sex Linked">Sex Linked</h1>
            <p>
                Sex linked traits are traits that are specifically attached to the sex chromosomes. As an example, 
                the triat for color blindness and hemophilia is attached to the X sex chromosome. Usually when talking 
                about sex linked traits, you'll mainly be focusing on the traits that are attached to the X chromosome since 
                it's larger and contains more genetic information (also it's easier and not many traits are attached to the Y 
                chromosome). <br/><br/>
                When doing these problems, you'll signify the sex chromosome and the trait as a superscript. You do a monohybrid 
                cross between the XX and the XY, and 50% of the results will be male and have a trait and the other 50% will be 
                female and have a trait. For males, since they only have 1 X chromosome, they will either inherit the trait 
                or not possess it completely. For females, they can be homozygous dominant or ressesive, or they can be hetrozygous 
                for the trait which would mean that they're a carrier. 
            </p>

            <br/>
            <h1 id="Pedigrees">Pedigrees</h1>
            <p>
              Pedigrees show the chart of a family tree. Normally, the shaded individuals have a specific trait you are looking for. 
              Questions for these types of problems might ask you to identify the genotype of each individual, or ask you if the 
              shaded individuals have a dominant or ressesive trait. They can also make you make a pedigree chart with some information 
              given. 
              <br/><br/>
              Pedigrees can also present the phenotype of individuals or the genotype. If it displays the phenotype, then you the 
              individuals are either shaded or not and you might be asked to find the genotype of the individuals. If they present the 
              genotype, then the individuals can also be half coloured, this means that the individual is a carrier of the trait and gives 
              you more information; for this, you'll be likely asked to construct a genotypic pedigree.
